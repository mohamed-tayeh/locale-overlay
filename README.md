This is the locale overlay that I use for my co-working Twitch stream.

2. Date: written in `dd.mm.yyyy`
3. Custom Time: shows `hh:mm:ss` or `hh:mm`
4. Custom fonts from [Google fonts], as well as font size and color
5. Custom images for location, date and time, as well as size
6. Custom background: color, opacity and roundness

## Installation

1. Download the zip to your desired location

## Configuration (styling)

### Styling

Within the folder, find and open the file called `configs.js` using `notepad`.

The file should look like this with comments on how to change the default configurations:

### Images

1. Place your chosen images in the media folder.
2. Change `locationImg`, `dateImg` and `timeImg` in the `configs.js`, respectively.
